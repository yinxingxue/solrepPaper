\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we formulate the optimal feature selection problem in SBSE as a MOIP model. Different from all previous studies that adopt MOEAs, we seek to apply MOIP methods. We try the \naiveSol~and CWMOIP, and prove the completeness of their solutions on small systems. However, they are not scalable. To address this, we propose an innovative MOIP method --- \ourSol. Evaluation shows that \ourSol~is scalable and finds significantly more non-dominant solutions than IBED in most cases, using similar or less time. In future, we will apply \ourSol~to more suitable SBSE problems.
